So, the other week, someone in #erlounge linked to an interesting
[Reddit post](http://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/2y5nc0/fault_tolerance_in_go/cp7m29l)
by someone switching from Erlang to Go:



I actually strongly disagree with almost everything he says, but the really
interesting part of the thread is when he starts talking about sending 10Mb
messages around and the fact that that 'breaks' the cluster. Other commentators
on the thread rightly point out that this is terrible for the heartbeats that
distributed erlang uses to maintain cluster connectivity and that you shouldn't
send large objects like that around.

And this is where I started thinking. In the Erlang community this is a known
problem, but why isn't there a general purpose solution? Riak's handoff uses
dedicated TCP connections to do handoff, but when reconciling siblings on a
GET/PUT? Riak uses disterl for that (this is one of the reasons that Riak
recommends against large objects).

So, even Riak is doing what 'everyone knows' not to do. Why isn't there a
library for that? I asked myself this one night at 2am before a flight to SFO
the next morning, and could not come up with an answer. So, I did the logical
thing, I turned my caremad into a prototype library.

After some Andy Gross style airplane-hacking, I had a basic prototype that
would, on demand, stand up a pool of TCP connections to another node (using the
same connection semantics as disterl) and then dispatch Erlang messages over
those pipes to the appropriate node. I even implemented a drop-in replacement
for gen_server:call() (although the return message came back over disterl).

The only problem? It was slow. Horrendously slow.

My first guess was that my naive gen_tcp:send(Socket, term_to_binary(Message))
was generating a giant, off-heap and quickly unreferenced binary (and it is).
So, I looked at how disterl does it. A bunch of gnarly C later, I had a BIF of
my own: [erlang:send_term/2](https://gist.github.com/Vagabond/efb0c1563ef7b94b3b27)

This, amazingly, worked, but with large messages (30+MB) I ended up causing
scheduler collapse because my BIF doesn't yield back to the VM or increment
reduction counts. I looked at adding that to the BIF and basically gave up.

So, I left it on the backburner for a couple weeks. When I came back, I had some
fresh insights. The first was: what if we had a 'term_to_iolist' function that
would preserve sharing? So I went off and implemented a half-assed one in Erlang,
that mainly tries to encode the common erlang types into the distributed Erlang
binary format but using iolists, not binaries (for those unfamiliar with Erlang,
iolists are often better when generating data to be written to files/sockets as
they can preserve sharing of embedded binaries, along with other things). For
all the 'hard' types, my code punts and calls term_to_binary and chops off the
leading '131' byte.

That worked, but performance was still miserable in my simple benchmark. I
pondered this for a while, and realized my benchmark wasn't fair to my library.
Distributed Erlang has an advantage because it is set up by the VM automatically
(fully connected clusters are the default in Erlang). My library, however,
lazily initalizes pooled connections to other nodes. So I added a 'prime' phase
to my test, where we send a tiny message around the cluster to 'prime the pump'
and initialize all the needed communication channels.

This *massively* helped performance, and, in fact, my library was now in
striking distance of disterl. However, I couldn't beat it, which seemed odd
since I had many TCP connections available, not just one. Again, after some
thought, I realized that my benchmark was running a single sender on each node,
and so there wasn't really any opportunity for my extra sockets to get used. I
reworked the benchmark to start several senders per node, and was able to leave
disterl in the dust (with 6 or 8 workers, on an 8 core machine, I see a 30-40%
improvement on sending 10Mb binary around a 6 node cluster and then ACKing the
sender when the final node receives it).

After that, I thought I was done. However, under extreme load, my library would
drop messages (but not TCP connections). This baffled me for quite a while until
I figured out that the way my connection pools were initializing was racy. It
turns out that I was relying on a registered Erlang supervisor process to be
present to detect if the pool for connecting to a particular node. However, the
fact that the registered supervisor was running doesn't guarantee that all of the
child processes are, and that is where I was running into trouble. Using a
separate ETS table to track actually started pools fixed the race without
impacting performance too much.

So, at this point, my library (called [teleport](https://github.com/Vagabond/teleport/)),
provides distributed Erlang
style semantics (mostly) over the top of tcp connection pools, without impacting
the distributed Erlang connections and disrupting heartbeats. A 'raw' Erlang
message like this:

```
{myname, mynode@myhost} ! mymessage
```

becomes:

```
teleport:send({myname, mynode@myhost}, mymessage)
```

And for gen_server:calls:

```
gen_server:call(RemotePid, message)
```

becomes:

```
teleport:gs_call(RemotePid, message)
```

The other OTP style messages (gen_server:cast(), and the gen_fsm/gen_event
messages) could also easily be supported. Right now, the *reply* to the
gen_server:call() comes back over distributed Erlang's channels, not over the
teleport socket. This is something that probably should change (the Riak Get/Put
use case would need it, for example). Another difference is that, because we're
using a pool of connections, the ordering of messages is not guaranteed at all.
If you need ordered messages, this is probably not the library for you.

Finally, I'm not actually using this for anything, nor do I have any immediate
plans to use it. I mostly did it to see if I could do it, and to see if such a
library was possible to implement without too many compromises. Contributions of
any kind are most welcome.
