 In which I use my newfound QuickCheck skills to find a bunch of bugs unit tests missed.

TL;DR
-----

 * Unit tests are great, but they can't test everything
 * Code always has bugs
 * QuickCheck helps you generate testcases at a volume where writing unit tests would be impractical
 * Negative testing is as important as positive testing (test the invalid inputs)
 * Automatically shrinking test cases to the minimal case is immensely helpful
 * If you write erlang commercially, you should really consider looking at property-based testing because it will find bugs you'll never be able to replicate otherwise

This week, the Basho engineering team flew out to Denver and spent a week at
the [Oxford Hotel](http://www.theoxfordhotel.com). Also attending was John Hughes, the CEO of [QuviQ](http://www.quviq.com/), who spent
the week teaching a bunch of us how to use his property-based software testing
tool, Quickcheck.

Property-based testing, for those unfamiliar with the term, is where you define
some 'properties' about your software and then QuickCheck tries to come up with
some combination of steps/inputs that will break your software. Beyond that it
will shrink the typically massive failing cases it finds down to the minimal
combination needed to provoke the failure (typically a handful of steps).
However, I'm not going to go into details on how QuickCheck works, just on the
results it provided.

After two days of working through the QuickCheck training material and the
exercises, we were ready to start writing our own QuickCheck tests against some
of Riak's code. I chose to start out with testing [poolboy](https://github.com/devinus/poolboy), the erlang worker
pool library Riak uses internally for some tasks.

Poolboy was actually third party code written by [devinus](https://github.com/devinus) from #erlang on
Freenode. I needed a worker pool implementation for implementing worker pools
in riak_core, specifically for doing asynchronous folds in riak_kv (but it's a
general feature in riak_core). I didn't feel like writing my own, so I looked
around and settled on poolboy, I added a bunch of tests, fixed a couple bugs,
added a way to check out workers without blocking if none were available and
started using it. 

Now, poolboy had 85% test coverage (and most of the remaining 15% was
irrelevant boilerplate) when I started QuickChecking it, and I felt pretty
happy with its solidity, so I didn't expect to find many bugs, if any. I was
very wrong.

So, my first step was to write a simple QuickCheck model for poolboy using
eqc_statem, the quickcheck helper for testing stateful code. The abstract model
for poolboy's internals is pretty simple, all we really need to keep track of
is the pid of the pool, the minimum size of the pool and by how much it can
'overflow' with ephemeral workers and the list of workers currently checked
out. From those bits of data, we can model how poolboy should behave, and those
become the 'property' we test.

Initially, I only tested starting, stopping, doing a non-blocking checkout and
checking a worker back in. I omitted testing blocking checkouts since they're a
little harder to do. This [initial property](https://github.com/basho/poolboy/blob/44a816ef7c04759ba5a6c66932563e07d5675ae3/test/poolboy_eqc.erl) checked out fine, no bugs found
(except in the property).

Next I added blocking checkouts, and suddenly the [property failed](https://gist.github.com/f12a33b261f18f931014#file_counterexample+1). The output
is a little hard to read, but the steps are;

 * Start poolboy with a size of 0 and an overflow of 1
 * Do a non-blocking checkout, which succeeds
 * Do a blocking checkout that fails (with a timeout)
 * Check the worker obtained in step 2 back in
 * Do another non-blocking checkout

The result of step 5 should be a worker, but we get full instead.
 
Turns out non-blocking checkouts have a bug if the timeout on the block happens
and then a worker becomes available. This happens because the caller is blocked
by the FSM storing the 'From' argument in a queue and popping that queue
whenever a worker becomes available. However, if the caller times out during
the checkout the 'From' is left in the queue, the next worker checked in will
be sent to a process no longer expecting it (which might not even be alive).
This means poolboy leaks workers in this case. I fix this by keeping track when
the checkout request is made, and what the timeout on it was and discarding
elements from the waiting queue who have expired.

After [making this change](https://github.com/basho/poolboy/commit/6a53f06f8f09ae1022bc8bac6c2196688c03d8c8), the counterexample quickcheck found now passes. The
next thing I decided to check was if workers dying while they're checked out is
handled correctly. I added a 'kill_worker' command which randomly kills a
checked out worker. I run this test with a lot of iterations and I find a
[second counterexample](https://gist.github.com/f12a33b261f18f931014#file_counterexample+2). This is what happens this time:

 * Start a pool with a size of 1 and overflow of 1
 * Do 3 non-blocking checkouts, first 2 succeed, the third rightfully fails
 * Check both of the workers we successfully checked out back in
 * Check a worker back out
* Kill it while its checked out
* Do 2 more checkouts, both should succeed but instead the second one reports the pool is 'full'

Clearly something is wrong. I actually re-ran this a bunch of times and found a
bunch of similar counterexamples. I had a really hard time debugging this until
John suggested looking at the pool's internal state to see what it thought was
going on. So, I added a 'status' call to poolboy that would report its internal
state (ready, overflow or full) and the number of the permanent and overflow
workers. John also suggested I use a dynamic precondition, which allowed me to
cross-check the model and pool's state before each step and exit() on any
discrepancy. This led to me finding lots of places where poolboy's internal
state was wrong, mainly around when it changed between the 3 possible states.

With those issues [fixed](https://github.com/basho/poolboy/commit/c2ba14ccd5dc6dc882d43db7d3190b94f033b185), I moved on to checking what happened if a worker died
while it was checked in. I wrote a command that would check out a worker, check
it back in and then kill it. QuickCheck didn't find any bugs initially, but
then I remembered [an issue poolboy had]https://github.com/devinus/poolboy/pull/4] where poolboy was using tons of ram
because it was keeping track of way too many process monitors. Whenever you
check a worker out of poolboy, poolboy monitors the pid holding the worker so
if it dies, poolboy can also kill the worker and create some free space in the
pool. So, I decided to add the number of monitors as one of the things
crosschecked between what the model expected and what poolboy actually had.

The [latest counterexample](https://gist.github.com/f12a33b261f18f931014#file_counterexample+3) went like this:

 * Pool size 2, no overflow
 * Checkout a worker Kill an idle worker (check it out, check it back in and then kill it)
 * Checkout a worker

The crosscheck actually blew up right before step 4, saying poolboy wasn't
monitoring any processes, when clearly it should have been monitoring who had
done the checkout in step 2. I looked at the code and found when it got an EXIT
message from a worker that wasn't currently checked out, it set the list of
monitors to the empty list, blowing away all tracking of who had what worker
checked out. This was pretty serious, but not that hard [to fix](https://github.com/basho/poolboy/commit/eacf28f164fc7a72af3d33a83ccc4e9c71019187); I just didn't
change the list of monitors in that case, instead of zeroing it out.

However, seeing that serious flaw made me wonder more about how poolboy handled
unexpected EXITs in other cases, like an EXIT from a process that wasn't a
worker. This could happen if you linked to the poolboy process for some reason
and then that process exited. You might even want to do this to make sure your
code knew if the pool exited, but in erlang links are both ways. So, I went
ahead and wrote a command to generate some spurious exit messages for the pool.
As was becoming normal, QuickCheck quickly found a [counterexample](https://gist.github.com/f12a33b261f18f931014#file_counterexample+4):

 * Pool size 1, no overflow
 * Checkout a worker
 * Send a spurious EXIT message
 * Kill the worker we checked out
 * Stop the pool

Right before step 5, the crosscheck failed telling me poolboy thought it had 2
workers available, not one. Clearly this was another bug, and sure enough
poolboy was assuming any EXIT messages were from workers and it'd start a new
worker to replace the dead one, actually growing the size of the pool beyond
the configured limits. So, I [changed the code](https://github.com/basho/poolboy/commit/e964cc52e6dbda45d7fdcddf76836a2d5703b042) to ignore EXIT messages from
non-worker pids, but to handle the death of checked in workers correctly.

After all the bugs around EXIT messages, I decided to randomly checkin
non-worker pids 10% of the time and see what happened. Again, poolboy wasn't
checking for this condition and strange things would happen to the internal
state. [The fix](https://github.com/basho/poolboy/commit/e6af0b6a65cc8405e17b71626cfd81fe3311882f) was very similar to the one for spurious EXIT messages.

Now, I was beginning to run out of ways to break poolboy. I looked at the test
coverage and saw that certain code around blocking checkouts was being hit by
the unit tests but not by QuickCheck. Now, QuickCheck can run commands serially
or parallel, and I had only been running commands serially so far. So, I added
a parallel property and tried to run it. It blew up telling me dynamic
preconditions weren't allowed. John told me this was actually the case, and so
I just commented it out. We'd lose our cool crosschecking but it could always
be uncommented if needed.

With the parallel tests running, I started to get counterexamples like this:

Common prefix

 * Start pool with size of 1, no overflow

Process 1

 * Check out a worker

Process 2

 * Check out a worker

Now, problem was, both checkouts would succeed. This is clearly wrong, until
you understand that process 1 might exit before process 2 does the checkout, in
which case poolboy notices and frees up space in the pool, at which point
process 2 can successfully and validly check out a worker. John again suggested
a neat trick where we'd add a final command to each branch that'd call
erlang:self() (which returns the current pid). I then modified the tracking of
checked out workers to include which worker had done the checkout, so we knew
which workers would be destroyed (and their slots in the pool freed) when one
of the parallel branches exited. This worked great and I was able to hit the
code paths that were unreachable from a purely serial test.

However, no matter how many iterations I ran, I couldn't get another valid
counterexample (I ran into some races in the erlang process registry, but those
are well known and harmless). At this point, finally, we knew that barring
flaws in the model, poolboy was pretty sound and this adventure came to an end.

Interestingly, at no point did any of the original unit tests fail. However, I
omitted describing the many bugs I found in my own model and how I was using
QuickCheck, since I can't really remember any of them, and they don't matter in
the long run.

Finally, I'd like to thank John Hughes for the great instruction and for being
patient and helpful in the face of the crazy things I ran into developing and
testing the QuickCheck property, Basho for being so dedicated to software
quality that they provide all of their engineers with this great tool and the
training to use it correctly and all the people that helped proof-read this
post.
